    title: "Architecting Angular Applications with Angular Libraries",
    description: "Angular offers a large ecosystem when it comes to separation and architecture of your application. There are often pieces of code that you don't just want to reuse within your application, but to make available to other applications in your organization or via package managers like npm over the Internet. This is where angular libraries come into play. In this talk, Fabian Gosebrink explores the way Angular Libraries are built, what the Angular Package format is good for, and how we can move code from an existing application to an Angular Library to reuse the code across multiple applications. This makes scaling and the architecture of angular applications a breeze.",

It turned out to be fun and useful, and I've been doing it ever since. In this talk, I will share my handwritten notes, explain how the process of making them works and why they are such a useful learning tool. Give it a try and don't worry, no artistic skills needed.",

    description: "Ah, Ionic's Capacitor, what a beautiful idea, an alternative to Cordova easier to use, easier to integrate in any framework, fully integrated with Ionic… Well, not really for me, at least at the beginning. After having developed lots of PWA these last years, I was a bit skeptic about the pertinence of native or hybrid apps, so when I heard of Capacitor I put it in the cool techno not really for me basket. Until I when to the website and I read: “Build web apps that run equally well on iOS, Android, Electron, and as Progressive Web Apps”. Oh, that really grabbed my interest. So I decided to use Capacitor on some of my PWA projects, to see if I could transform them in native iOS or Android apps. And this talk is the feedback of this process, my first steps with Capacitor in some real life applications, what did work for me and what didn’t, and what I learnt in the process.",
